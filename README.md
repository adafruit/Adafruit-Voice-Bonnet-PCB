### Description

Your Raspberry Pi computer is like an electronic brain - and with the Adafruit Voice Bonnet you can give it a mouth and ears as well! Featuring two microphones and two 1 Watt speaker outputs using a high quality I2S codec, this Pi add-on will work with any Raspberry Pi with a 2x20 connector - from the Pi Zero up to the Pi 4 and beyond (basically all but the very first ones made).

The on-board WM8960 codec uses I2S digital audio for great quality recording and playback - so it sounds a lot better than the headphone jack on the Pi (or the no-headphone jack on a Pi Zero). We put ferrite beads and filter capacitors on every input and output to get the best possible performance, and all at a great price.

We specifically designed this bonnet for use with making machine learning projects such as DIY voice assistants - for example see this guide on creating a DIY Google Assistant. But you could do various voice activated or voice recognition projects. With two microphones, basic voice position can be detected as well.

* WM8960 codec uses I2S digital audio for both input and output
* On/Off privacy switch to deactivate audio so you know it can't be recording.
* Two analog microphone inputs (left and right)
* Two 1W speaker outputs
* 3.5mm stereo headphone or line-out audio
* Plugs into any Raspberry Pi with 2x20 headers

With the extra space on the PCB we also added some bonus extras!

* Push button - Use to change modes, activate the voice assistant, anything you like!
* Three DotStar RGB LEDs - add LED feedback or make a rainbow light show
* STEMMA QT connector - plug in any of our I2C sensors, OLEDs, or accessories.
* 3 Pin JST STEMMA connector - for larger accessories, like NeoPixels, a relay or servo

No assembly required! Simply pop it onto your Pi and install the microphone/speaker card using our installer script. Your Pi will then have stereo input and output for use in any software - they appear as any other speaker/mic would. Play music or record audio with ease. For audio input, the two microphones are built into the Bonnet. For audio output, you can either use the Line-out/Headphone 3.5mm stereo jack or you can plug in one or two of our enclosed speakers. For DIY speakers, solder any 1W+ speaker to one of these JST 2-PH cables. If you'd like to stack another HAT or bonnet on top, use a 2x20 stacking header to feed through the 2x20 connector.
